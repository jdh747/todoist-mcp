    'Get all tasks from Todoist using a filter.\n\n' +
    'Filters are custom views for your tasks based on specific criteria. You can narrow down your lists according to task name, date, project, label, priority, date created, and more.\n\n' +
    "There are a range of symbols you can use to filter the tasks. For example, 'today' will get all tasks due today.\n\n" +
    'Here’s a rundown of some of the more advanced filters you can use in Todoist:\n\n' +
    'In order to create filters based on keywords, you can use `search`: followed by a keyword.\n' +
    '- See all tasks that contain the word "Meeting", use this: "search: Meeting"\n' +
    '- See all tasks that contain the word "Meeting" that are due today, use this: "search: Meeting & today"\n' +
    '- See all tasks that contain either the word "Meeting" or "Work", use this: "search: Meeting | search: Work"\n' +
    '- See all tasks that contain the word "email", use this: "search: email"\n' +
    '- See all tasks that contain web links, use this: "search: http"\n\n' +
    'Create a filter to either see or exclude sub-tasks in the view:\n' +
    '- See all sub-tasks, use this: "subtask"\n' +
    '- See all parent tasks while excluding their sub-tasks, use this: "!subtask"\n\n' +
    'See all tasks scheduled for a specific date:\n' +
    '- View all tasks scheduled for January 3rd, use this: "date: Jan 3"\n' +
    '- See all tasks dated before a specific date, use this: "date before: May 5" or "date before: 5/5"\n' +
    '- See all tasks dated after a specific date, use this: "date after: May 5" or "date after: 5/5"\n' +
    '- See all tasks scheduled within the next four hours and all overdue tasks, use this: "date before: +4 hours"\n' +
    '- See all tasks dated in the current working week, use this: "date before: sat"\n' +
    '- See all tasks that are dated for next week, use this: "(date: next week | date after: next week) & date before: 1 week after next week"\n' +
    '- See all tasks dated within the current calendar month, use this: "date before: first day"\n' +
    '- See active tasks dated yesterday, along with today\'s tasks listed below, use this: "date: yesterday, today"\n' +

    '- See all tasks dated today and before a specific time, use this: "date: today & date before: today at 2pm"\n' +

    'You can write a date in any of these ways:\n' +
    '- Specific date: 10/5/2022, Oct 5th 2022\n' +
    '- Specific date and time: 10/5/2022 5pm, Oct 5th 5pm\n' +
    '- Relative date: today, tomorrow, yesterday, 3 days (dated in the next 3 days), -3 days (dated in the past 3 days)\n' +
    '- Days of the week: Monday, Tuesday, Sunday\n\n' +
    'Examples with deadlines:\n' +
    '- See all tasks with no deadlines, use this: "no deadline"\n' +
    '- See all tasks with a deadline, use this: "!no deadline"\n' +
    '- See all tasks with a deadline today, use this: "deadline: today"\n' +
    '- See all tasks with a deadline within the next 7 days: "deadline after: yesterday & deadline before: in 7 days"\n' +
    '- See all tasks with overdue deadlines: "deadline before: today"\n\n' +
    "Due takes into consideration the date and deadline fields. If a task has both, a date and deadline, due prioritizes the date. If the task does not have a date, due will check if the deadline matches filter criteria. If you don't use deadlines, due and date filters will return the same results.\n" +
